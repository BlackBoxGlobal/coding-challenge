# Three Challenges

### Rather than a days-long-needlessly-stressful-live-coding-interview at a white board, we request you complete the these three challenges.

1. HTML and CSS layout - There is a sample image in the layout directory. Use HTML and CSS to duplicate the layout.
2. Ruby sorting - The script.rb file contains some sample data that needs to be restructured.
3. Rails relation DB design - The seeds.rb file contains some sample data of Actors and Characters. Please build a simple rails application where an actor can have multiple characters associated to them via a GUI. 

When you've finished please create a PR from this repo and we'll schedule some time to discuss the work.
